PROBLEM 1:

In this problem, you will be downloading some files from online, then creating a custom project with git initialized. You will then one by one structure the files and make commits to git as needed.

1. Download this repository from the homepage by clicking "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP". You will be using the files from the /stuff directory.
2. Once the repository has been downloaded, go ahead and unzip it.

3. Achieve the following structure ONLY using command line:

~/Desktop/pset2
    /assets
        /images
            amazon.jpg
            facebook.png
            google.jpg
            twitter.png
        /memes
            meme.jpg
        /src
            foo.js
    app.js
    hello.html

    ```
    cd ~
    cd Desktop
    cd pset2
    mkdir assets
    cd assets
    mkdir images
    cd images
    touch amazon.jng
    touch facebook.jng
    touch google.jng
    touch twitter.png
    cd assets
    mkdir memes
    cd memes
    touch meme.jpg
    cd assets
    mkdir src
    cd src
    touch foo.js
    cd assets
    touch app.js
    touch hello.html


4. Open `hello.html` using a code editor and change "SOME_CLASS" to "Full Stack: Nights & Weekends". Save it.

cd Desktop
cd assets
code .


5. You should have the following commits:
